# Neighborhood Map
This project uses the Knockout and jQuery JavaScript libraries in addition to the Google Maps and Foursquare APIs to create a map that displays the best dog parks in Austin. When a park is selected on the map or on the sidebar, an info window appears with a Foursquare picture, street address, and link to the park's Foursquare page. The search bar at the top of the sidebar can be used to filter the listed parks.

## How to Use the Application
Clone or download this repository, and then open the **index.html** file in your browser of choice.
